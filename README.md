# TCP Demo App (Server & Client)

This is a simple TCP demo application consisting of a server and a client, developed using C# .NET WinForms. 
The solution contains two projects: **TCP-Client** and **TCP-Server**. The server and client communicate with each 
other over a TCP/IP connection, allowing them to exchange messages.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine and open the solution in Visual Studio/Rider.

Then, run both Server and Client app.

### Connecting Client - Server in the same machine

The client and server are configured to connect to each other using the loopback address.

> **Note** `localhost` can also be referenced by the loopback IP address `127.0.0.1`. This IP is fixed.

In TCP Server app, click `Start Server` button to start the server. In TCP Client app, click `Connect` button to connect to the server.
Now, you can start sending messages between the client and server.

#### Connecting Client - Server in different machines

In this section, I will be using Android since I don't have extra laptop to test this out. Feel free to use any other TCP Client
on any devices.

Download [TCP Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hardcodedjoy.tcpclient) app from the Google Play Store.

From the TCP Server app, start the server. Notice there is an host:port information in the "On your network" section.

> **Note** Your PC local IP address can also be found by running `ipconfig` in the command prompt.

On your Android device, open the TCP Client app and enter the host and port information from the server app.

Now, you can start sending messages between the client and server.

### Bonus: LED Demo

This is a bonus demo to show how the client can control the virtual 'LED' on the server.
